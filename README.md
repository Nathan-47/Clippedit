## Setup
### Use of local server or libraries in project?
For the database and the form to be able to connect I had to use a local server xampp.

### Instructions on how to access and open the doc for localhost?
Below is a guide that shows how to open the project.
*	Get the server working.

*	Download the project via zip file, this can be located under the code dropdown that is highlighted green.

*	When the zip file is downloaded go to the file and extract the docs.

*	Extract the docs into the localhost directory file. This file should be the one that allows the downloaded files to be read and be displayed on the local server thus showing the full site. i.e.- For xampp (local server program) the directory file would be htdocs.

### Instructions when on site
*	To open the site on a web browser, go to the URL and type localhost and this should take you to the landing page.

*	When on the landing page click sign up and it should take you to the user log in page then choose what option you need which is either login into the site or sign up to the site.
